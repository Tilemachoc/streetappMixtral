{"text": "HEMPSTEAD, N.Y.-- A former Long Island high school girls volleyball coach was arrested Thursday and charged with raping one of his teenage players. Shock and outrage swept across Sacred Heart Academy after 22-year-old Jason Maser, a former volleyball coach for the all-girls Catholic school, was accused of raping a 15-year-old player while working part-time as her coach at the college prep school in Hempstead. \"It's scary,\" one person said. \"It's horrible that someone would take advantage of their position,\" parent Sheena Falloon said. The charges against Maser include rape, criminal sexual act and endangering the welfare of a child. His mother remained silent while walking out of his arraignment Friday, but the family's lawyer said bail of $75,000 in cash or a $150,000 bond was unfair. \"Obviously the bail set was very high. We're going to get Jason out, and we'll deal with the case going forward,\" the lawyer said. The felony complaint alleges the sexual acts happened at least twice inside his Jeep Cherokee -- once in February, and a second time just two weeks ago. The vehicle was seen Friday parked outside his Syosset home, where he was arrested. His neighbors are stunned. \"It's a very nice neighborhood. You don't expect that, right?\" neighbor Kelly Filippone said. Detectives say Maser also worked for B&B Volleyball Club, and the victim played for that team as well. The club said in a statement that Maser underwent \"mandatory training with US Safe Sport and had been screened by USA Volleyball which includes a background check.\" When the league learned about the accusations, they cut ties with Maser and notified parents. Sacred Heart said in statement it then \"took immediate steps to ensure that the coach had no further access to Sacred Heart's premises or any social activities.\" Maser is due back in court in April. If he is convicted, he could face up to four years in prison. Manhasset Schools also confirmed Maser was a high school coach for their boys volleyball team for one season in 2022.

{"text": "NEW YORK- Two suspects are in custody in thebrutal murder of a woman whose body was found hidden in a duffel bagin a New York City apartment. Halley Tejada, 19, and Kensly Alston, 18, were arrested in York, Penn., about 185 miles from Manhattan for allegedly driving a stolen car. The U.S. Marshals say the two are considered persons of interest in beating death of 52-year-old Nadia Vitels. An NYPD source says Tejada is from Washington Heights and Alston is from the Bronx. Her body was found in a duffel bag in a closet at a 19th floor apartment on 31st Street in Manhattan's Kips Bay neighborhood back on March 14. The medical examinerruled her death a homicide due to blunt force trauma to the head. Her son made the discovery after coming to check on herbecause he hadn't heard from her. An NYPD source said it's alleged that Tejada and Alston were squatting in the apartment when Vitels showed up to move either herself or someone else in. Sources say the two suspects were seen on surveillance video in the building and outside stealing Vitels' car from the street, where it was parked. The vehicle was traced to New Jersey and then Pennsylvania, where it was involved in an accident on March 13. According to authorities, Alston, who was allegedly driving Vitels' Lexus at the time of the crash, initially gave officers responding to the crash a fake name. The two were being hunted by the Joint Fugitive Task Force. CBS New York spoke with immediate family members of both suspects. Neither seemed to know much about Tejada or Alston's recent whereabouts. Tejada was arrested back in December for breaking the glass door of his last known address in Manhattan. Alston has a prior as a juvenile for assault. The building's super said he's heard about potential squatters. \"They say that, but I've always believed that no one moved in,\" the super said. The elevators in the building have a door on either side, and a key system for each apartment. That means it can be locked, and the elevator door won't open on the side with your apartment. It's unclear how the two suspects would've gained access to an apartment. Vitels was killed after traveling to Manhattan from Spain to prepare the apartment to be occupied, sources told CBS New York. The apartment had been vacant for months after the death of Vitels' mother. Vitels was seen on surveillance video coming and going from the apartment, sources said. Police sources believe the suspects, who had been squatting there, returned to the apartment themselves after Vitels had arrived, surprised her and beat her to death. At her funeral earlier this week, her son remembered her as a woman who always took care of others but was just about to move into New York City and focus on herself. \"In the last few months, she traveled to Germany, Spain and Miami and had the best time of her life,\" he said. A life brutally ended, police say, at the hands of strangers. Alice Gainer joined CBS2 as a reporter and anchor in January 2013. She covers breaking, feature and general assignment stories."}

There's not really security that I feel is present,\" Schwartz said. \"So that's what we're battling now -- the perception versus reality,\" Caban said.

In his desperation he was emotional, but distressed does not mean dangerous.\" Last week, Penny's attorney, Thomas Kenniff, praised the Brooklyn district attorneyfor not pursuing charges against a subway rider who shot an \"agitator\" with his own gun during a fight on a train, and hinted that he may point to that case as he formulates penny's defense. \"While we still hold out hope that the Manhattan District Attorney's Office will see the injustice in continuing this prosecution, we are prepared to defend Mr. Penny at trial and have every confidence that he will be fully exonerated,\" Kenniff said.

His devastated family spoke with CBS New York on Sunday. \"It's just like a horror story at the end,\" Andrele Peters said. Peters is still trying to make sense of what happened to her stepdad, 61-year-old Carlyle Thomas, better known in hisEast Flatbushneighborhood as \"Quench.\" His family says he parked the van he uses for work to drive children to school at his usual spot on Saturday night. \"He parked his car at the gas station. He had a couple drinks,\" Peters said. \"Him getting that call to come back downstairs is what ended his life.\" Thomas' stepdaughters shared that for $10, the Shell employees let neighbors park there. But on Saturday night, an employee says Thomas refused to pay when asked and walked home to his nearby apartment building. The employee says about two hours later, a tow truck was called and so was Thomas. \"One of the staff members called him personally on the phone and said, 'Your car is being towed right now. It's already on the tow truck,'\" Alexis Peters said. The Shell employee said an upset Thomas returned and disputed the tow, getting into a heated argument with the tow truck driver. Police said Thomas was punched in the face, and knocked onto the pavement. He was rushed to the hospital, where he died. Police said the 30-year-old tow truck driver was taken into custody. \"I'm just happy that guy was caught and I just hope that time is served because you just took someone's life,\" Andrele Peters said. The gas station doesn't have any visible signage about Forrester Towing or any tow company. CBS New York called Forrester Towing and received a \"no comment\" response. Thomas' stepdaughters said they feel the employees there should be held accountable. \"He could've made a different phone call, maybe just to call him and notify him to just move the car and I'm sure he would've came and just moved the car,\" Andrele Peters said. Loved ones gathered at a vigil for Thomas on Sunday night. He was known for his cooking and sense of humor. \"Very friendly, fun, was the life of everything, respected, talk to anyone,\" one person said. Police charged the tow truck driver, 30-year-old Kevon Johnson, with one count of recklessly causing physical injury."}

The shootings occurred Saturday morning at two separate homes in nearby Levittown, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. Trenton police said Andre Gordon Jr. was taken into custody a couple blocks from the home where the standoff had been taking place. Police said he had left the house before the standoff, and officers spotted him. UPDATE: Andre Gordon was arrested, but not at the home in Trenton where the SWAT team thought he was barricaded. A patrol officer spotted him walking on New York Avenue, a few blocks away.

SWAT teams had surrounded a home on Phillips Avenue in Trenton where they believed Gordon may be inside with hostages. Trenton police later said all residents who were inside the home had been safely evacuated. Trenton police say all residents who were inside the attached home where Andre Gordon is barricaded have been safely evacuated. The SWAT team is still urging the Falls Township murder suspect to come out of the home on Phillips Ave. and surrender.pic.twitter.com/sPqhQru8p1 According to Falls Township Police, the situation unfolded Saturday morning, when a suspect allegedly forced himself into a home on Viewpoint Lane in Levittown. Karen Gordon, 52, and Kera Gordon, 13, were fatally shot. Karen Gordon is Andre Gordon's stepmother, officials said, while Kera Gordon is his sister. The suspect then allegedly moved on to a second home on Edgewood Lane in Levittown, where officials say he shot and killed the 25-year-old Taylor Daniel, who is the mother of Andre Gordon's children. Following the shootings and carcjackings in Trenton and Bucks County, Pennsylvania,, law enforcement tracked Gordon to the Phillips Avenue home. The manhunt put multiple Bucks County communities on high alert, leading to a shelter-in-place, the closures of several local businesses, and the cancellation of the Falls Township St. Patrick's Day Parade. The violence began before 9 a.m. at a home on Viewpoint Lane in Levittown, authorities said. In a news briefing, Bucks County District Attorney Jennifer Schorn said the suspect \u2014\u00a0 armed with an AR-style rifle and possibly other guns \u2014 pulled up to the home in a vehicle that he had carjacked from Trenton. He then broke inside the residence and shot and killed Karen and Kera Gordon. Three others in the home were unhurt. \"Three other people were in that home during the shooting,\" Schorn said. \"They were able to hide from Gordon and avoid being shot as he searched for them in the house.\" About 10 minutes later, the suspect drove to another home on Edgewood Lane in Levittown, where he again broke in, Schorn said. There, the mother of the suspect's two children were shot and killed, Schorn said. Those two children, the victim's mother, and another relative were inside the Edgewood Lane home at the time, Schorn disclosed, and the suspect bludgeoned one of them with the rifle. That person is expected to survive their injuries, Schorn said. No one else in that home was injured. The suspect then fled the scene after that shooting, Schorn said. About 10 minutes later, police believe the suspect committed a second carjacking at a Dollar General store on Bristol Pike in Morrisville, Pennsylvania, fleeing in a Honda CRV. That Honda was later found close to the Trenton home where the suspected hostage situation took place. Police were seen leading people out of a second-floor window on that block. It was not clear if those people were hostages or neighbors. Authorities are still investigating how the suspect acquired the rifle. Details on the first carjacking that occurred in Trenton were not immediately provided. Middletown Township police said Gordon is homeless but has ties to Trenton and Bucks County. Following the shootings Saturday morning, Falls Township residents received emergency notifications to shelter-in-place. The push notifications told residents to stay inside their homes, away from windows. As police began searching for Gordon, the Falls Township St. Patrick's Day Parade was getting underway. Falls Township Police Chief Nelson Whitney   said officers went up and down the parade route, warning the crowd to leave the area and head home. The shelter-in-place lasted about three hours before it was lifted. By then, the investigation had moved across the Delaware River to Trenton. \"I got all my kids together and we got into the center of the house and locked all our windows and doors,\" resident David Armitage Jr. said. Middletown Township police said they directed the Sesame Place amusement park and the Oxford Valley Mall to close Saturday morning. A Target store and several other businesses in Middletown also elected to close, police said. Sesame Place opted to remain closed for the rest of the day after the shelter-in-place was lifted, the department said. \"For something like this to happen here and in a couple other sections in this short amount of time.

Police had said their mom called 911 that morning reporting they were unconscious, cold and foaming from the mouth and nose. Police sources had saidthe kids were sent home sick from school the week before. Upon learning they could not be revived that day, the emotionally distraught mom was taken to a hospital. On Thursday, after the detectives left, CBS New York knocked on the apartment door, but no one answered. Neighbors were shocked to learn that the medical examiner has now deemed the deaths of the Kantanka twins a homicide, and that the kids were suffocated. \"I don't know. It's very sad,\" Mavis Ohene said. Some who knew the family asked CBS New York not to show their faces, citing the ongoing investigation. \"I know their mom. She's a nice woman,\" one person said. \"We used to see the mother or going up in the elevator or coming down in the elevator and the kids was always coming up to you and saying hello and you would never suspect it,\" another said. That person says the night before, the mom came into the hallway screaming and neighbors responding to the commotion saw what appeared to be lifeless bodies through the open door. Police sources say the father worked in Westchester County and did not stay at the home most of the week. \"They were a loving family. I don't understand it,\" a neighbor said. Police sources said the parents are being re-interviewed. No one is in custody and no criminal charges have been filed. A representative for the Bronx district attorney would only say the case will be presented to a grand jury. Why the twins were killed and who did it is a question now haunting people who fondly remember the joyful brother and sister.
